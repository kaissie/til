# P vs NP Problem
People wonder whether everything in NP would turn out to be in P or if there were some NP problems that were truly harder than the ones in P.

## P
The set of problems is a class that basically includes all the problems that can be solved by a reasonably fast program, like multiplication or alphabetizing a list of names.


## NP
Around and including P we sort of discovered a class called NP.<br>
That's all the problems where, if you're given a correct solution you can at least check it in a reasonable amount of time.<br>
NP was totally maddening, because it contained lots of important problems like vehicle routing and scheduling and circuit design and databases.<br>
