# Propositional logic

## Proposition
A proposition is the basic building block of logic.<br>
It is defined as declarative sentence that it either True or False, but not both.<br>
The Truth Value of a proposition is True(debited as T) if it is a true statement,
and False(denoted as F) if it is a false statement.

To represent propositions, <b>propositional variables</b> are used.<br>
By Convention, these variables are represented by small alphabets such as p, q, r, s.

The area of logic which deals with propositions is called propositional calculus or propositional logic.
It also includes producing new propositions using existing ones. Propositions constructed using one or more propositions are called compound propositions. The propositions are combined together using Logical Connectives or Logical Operators.

## Grammar
The language of a propositional logic consists of
1. a set of <b>primitive symbols</b>, variously referred to as atomic formulas, placeholders, proposition letters, or variables, and
1. a set of <b>operator symbols</b>, variously interpreted as logical operators or logical connectives.

The language of L, also known as its set of formulas, well-formed formulas, is inductively defined by the following rules:
1. Base: Any element of the alpha set A is a formula of L.
1. If p 1 , p 2 , … , p j  are formulas and f is in Ω j, then f ( p 1 , p 2 , … , p j ) )  is a formula.
1. Closed: Nothing else is a formula of L.

Repeated applications of these rules permits the construction of complex formulas. For example:
1. By rule 1, p is a formula.
1. By rule 2, ¬ p is a formula.
1. By rule 1, q is a formula.
1. By rule 2, ( ¬ p ∨ q ) is a formula.
